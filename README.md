## About me

My name is Taylor Popp (she/her) and I'm an aspiring policy analyst from Central California. I am currently in the Master of Science in Public Policy and Management at Carnegie Mellon University. In this program, I've taken a variety of courses pertaining to policy analysis, quantitative methods, and special topics such as transportation and environmental policy.

I am broadly interested in environmental policy, with special interest in urban policy and environmental justice. I want to help improve the resiliency of our cities while maintaining the well-being of current residents of historically underserved communities.

## What I hope to learn

In Advanced GIS, I hope to further develop my mapping skills and expand my use of analytical tools in GIS. I would specifically like to learn about automation of GIS processes in Python and gain better understanding of project management skills in geospatial projects. Finally, I hope to learn about what it's like to do GIS projects outside of a classroom setting.

In Telling Stories with Data, I hope to learn how to make intuitive, captivating data visualizations. A crucial component of moving cities toward equitable and sustainable practices is convincing various audiences that these changes are necessary. This involves clarity and relatability in the way information is presented, and I expect this class will help me to improve upon these skills.

After graduation, I will be a Lead GIS Analyst for the City of Philadelphia. I would especially like to work on improving well-being of urban residents through things like land use policy, public transportation improvements, and methods of improving public and environmental health. I hope to use the skills I develop in this course to help municipal governments convey information to residents and other stakeholders about these important issues.
