## Changes Since Part 2

Since completing part 2 of this project, I made several changes regarding my choice in audience, the number of visualizations, and the overall aesthetic of the story. Overall, I think these changes improved the clarity and impactfulness of the project. 

### Audience

My interviewees in part 2 did not capture as diverse of a group as I would have liked. It would have been best to get input from people of color who are interested in closing the racial gap in green space to make sure I'm framing everything in the best light. That being said, getting input from White interviewees helped me make sure that I am getting through to those whose overwhelming presence in public space may contribute to inequity. I don't think White folks should avoid the trails, but due to their rates of usage, they are the ones in the best position to change the culture of outdoor spaces. For that reason, I tried to explain clearly how historic segregation impacts dynamics today. Hopefully that gets people on board with being more inviting and doesn't merely shut them off from the idea that their behavior is contributing. No one wants to feel that way, and I tried here to balance that. 

### Visualizations

There are more visualizations in part 3 than there were in part 2. This is because the story wasn't flowing as well as I wanted it to. In particular, I added a couple of visualizations at the beginning to help open the broad topic: people of color have less access to green space than White people. This was a suggestion from one of my interviewees. According to that interviewee, including an introduction helps ground the audience in the topic and doesn't create confusion about whether the presentation is about urban green space or national park spaces; it's about all of it. I also added additional visualizations to depict the health benefits of green space to develop credibility with the audience. Finally, I changed the visualization showing national park visitors from a stacked bar chart to an indidiaul statistic; ths seemed more intuitive and engaging. 

### Aesthetic

In part 2 of the project, I hadn't fully decided on an aesthetic or any particular color scheme. Since this is a somber topic about inequity, I figured that a dark theme would be more impactful than the default white theme from part 2. Since the topic is on green space, it also seemed natural to use green in the presentation. That left me with uncertainty, though. My first inclination was to use red as the additional color, but that ran the risk of 1) looking like a Christmas theme and 2) being difficult to interpret for people with color blindness. I therefore decided to use orange alongside green. This seems to have maintained the urgency I wanted from the red while avoiding the previously mentioned issues.
