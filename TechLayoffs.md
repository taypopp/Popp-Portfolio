## Original Visualization

While scrolling Twitter, I saw a [tweet](https://twitter.com/ECONdailycharts/status/1589981363666558977?s=20&t=Bb6CQG6eA0rLbPP7uwkYBA) from The Economist Data Team (@ECONdailycharts) from November 8, 2022:

I followed the link in the tweet to an article from The Economist from November 7, 2022: [Meta will lay off 13% of its workforce](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/11/07/meta-will-lay-off-13-of-its-workforce?utm_medium=social-media.content.np&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=editorial-social&utm_content=discovery.content&%3Ffsrc%3Dscn%2F=tw%2Fdc). This article showed a different version of the visualization:

There is a lot going on in this visualization. The vertical axis represents different industries under the tech umbrella and the horizontal axis represents time as months in 2022. Each circle represents a company, and the size of the circle represents the number of 2022 layoffs that have occurred. The company is placed on the time axis based on the most recent layoff date, but the size represents all 2022 layoffs, regardless of date. 

The source of this data is [Crunchbase](https://news.crunchbase.com/startups/tech-layoffs-2022/). The data has been updated since The Economist article was written, and Amazon surpassed Meta in layoffs on November 14.

### Where It Went Wrong

I chose this visualization because, while the information being conveyed is interesting, there is too much information in the visualization that is not relevant to the main point. The point of the article is represented in the title: "Meta will lay off 13% of its workforce." The point is the highlight high rates of layoffs in the tech industry. 

The first thing that draws away from this goal is the number of circles in the visualization. Only the top 6 highest layoff companies are labelled, but aside from that, there are countless (literally, because they cover one another and aren't visible) other circles that have no company or layoff label. This does provide context for the six largest bubbles, but with the concept of layoffs, I think most people reading The Economist can tell that 11,000 layoffs is a lot; you don't need all the little circles to inform that.

Additionally, the time axis is not relevant. All of the data is from 2022 and the visualization is not comparing layoffs across a particular date or event, so individual dates within the year do not add to the story. Adding the additional data dimension merely draws away from the simple comparison of layoffs. 

Finally, the use of circles themselves makes the comparisons more difficult. The use of circles to represent the number of layoffs only allows the viewer to make comparisons with large discrepancies, because small discrepancies are hard to see with round shapes.
