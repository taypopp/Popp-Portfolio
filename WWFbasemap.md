## Map Style

![palette](https://taypopp.github.io/Popp-Portfolio/palette.png)

I pulled inspiration for the map's style from the WWF website. There is simplicity in WWF's branding, with only solid black and white in the logo itself. The orange color is used for text and buttons on the site, as well.

Beyond that, there aren't any colors that are consistently used by WWF. Given the nature of the organization, green comes up a lot; I pulled this green from one of the images on the site.

I also included two shades of gray. While there are more interesting colors used across the homepage (the image with the heading "People and communities," for instance), but shades of gray with a couple pops of color feels more consistent with WWF's brand.
