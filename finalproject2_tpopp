## User Research

The target audience of this story is a combination of policy makers and those who either already engage in outdoor activities or would like to start doing so. These are the people who can either benefit from the information or are in a position to do something about it. 

I am personally a fan of outdoor activities, so I am familiar with several individuals in this category. I reached out to people who I know enjoy hikes and camping, as well as those who frequently use urban green space.
