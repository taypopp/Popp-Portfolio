## [Storyboard](https://preview.shorthand.com/uB4iZKHSfW6qM1d6)

In creating this story board, I wonder whether the importance of this issue comes across. The current mood with the images I've chosen leans toward the green space visuals, but does that distract from the environmental justice issue? I want to make sure that the main points of this story come across and that viewing this storyboard invokes feelings about discrimination rather than feelings about green spaces.

I also want to make sure the storyboard is accessible to the audience of interest. I'm largely hoping to target people who enjoy the outdoors, as they are the ones who need to make it a more inviting space for people of color. Those who enjoy the outdoors, though, span a broad range of people. I need to make sure my data visualizations are approachable while still being informative.

## User Research

The target audience of this story is a combination of policy makers and those who either already engage in outdoor activities or would like to start doing so. These are the people who can either benefit from the information or are in a position to do something about it. 

I am personally a fan of outdoor activities, so I am familiar with several individuals in this category. I reached out to people who I know enjoy hikes and camping, as well as those who frequently use urban green space. 

### Student/Hiker, White, 20's

| Question | Response |
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| What is your main takeaway from this storyboard? | Green spaces of all types are extremely segregated and dominated by white people, which is bad for obvious reasons. |
| How do you feel after looking at this storyboard? | Unease at the part I may have played in this, frustration. |
| How important of a problem do you think this is? | Extremely important, associated with all sorts of health outcomes and exercise and mental health. |
| Is there anything you were confused about in the storyboard? | Why are there negative associations between green space use and asthma? |
| What can you personally do to help this problem? | Get more involved in efforts to create and maintain green spaces that are accessible to more diverse audiences. |
| Is there anything you would do differently in this storyboard? | Add a caption or legend to the map at the top.  |

### Professional/Hiker, White, 20's

| Question | Response |
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| What is your main takeaway from this storyboard? | There are significant differential health outcomes as a result of the significant differences in green space by race. |
| How do you feel after looking at this storyboard? | Intrigued about the information, it's interesting, but also frustrated about the implications of how these systems exist. |
| How important of a problem do you think this is? | It's so specific; health is definitely important but health is a multifaceted beyond greenspace. I'd want to know the effect-per-dollar of investing in green space for public helath outcomes. |
| Is there anything you were confused about in the storyboard? | No confusion. The graph for the health meta analysis could be confusing, but the explanation made it understandable. |
| What can you personally do to help this problem? | Being more intentional in how interactions happen in the public green spaces. |
| Is there anything you would do differently in this storyboard? | I wonder if the meta analysis data could be presented in a more intuitive way that wouldn't require as much explanation. |

### Student/Hiker, White, 30's

| Question | Response |
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| What is your main takeaway from this storyboard? | Access to public lands is currently inequitable but we can do something about it.|
| How do you feel after looking at this storyboard? | Frustration, and then hope. |
| How important of a problem do you think this is? | Personally, I think it's a big problem. |
| Is there anything you were confused about in the storyboard? | The initial bolded line about urban green space made me think we were only talking about urban spaces, but then we moved to public lands. It could have been introduced as both early on before to avoid that. The chart about the health outcomes was confusing. I didn't know what the associations were. |
| What can you personally do to help this problem? | I have less understanding of what I can do for the urban space. I can't increase green spaces, nor am I a hiring manager of a public land agency, nor am I in an organization such as Outdoor Afro. I can be more inclusive when I'm in public spaces. |
| Is there anything you would do differently in this storyboard? | I was thinking about the initial Pittsburgh map. You could take out the stuff on urban areas and focus on national public lands to simplify, or you could add more information about the reasons (access, segregation, etc.) to tie it in better. Just include an intro about "there are different kinds of public space" to put everyone on the same page about the land we're talking about. Access: cost of renting a campsite/park day pass/gear. |

### Next Steps
- Finalize the visualizations, especially for the health benefits.
- Play with the park visitation visual. Census data considers Hispanic as its own race in this table that was used, whereas the park visitation numbers do not. I need to pull original Census data.
- Add a legend to the Pittsburgh map.
- Bulk written sections.
- Change the title of the visitation graph.
- add an introduction to ground the audiend in the issue
- Be more explicit about what the individual can do about the issue.
