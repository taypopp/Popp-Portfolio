## General Government Debt of Selected Countries, 2019

This visualization shows the debt-to-GDP ratio of available countries in a map format. I thought this would be a useful way to display the data because it allows the viewer to see any potential geographic trends in the data. To do this, I filtered the data to only those values from 2019, then I merged it with Flourish's default GEOJSON for a world map. 

I struggled with the popups; I was not able to disable popups for countries without debt data. I also struggled with the colors. Ideally, the diverging color scheme would have made its shift at 100%. This would distinguish between countries with less debt than GDP and those with more debt than GDP. However, I think the current color scheme is still helpful identifying those countries with the lowest and highest ratios.
