# A Gap in Green Space

Green space access brings with it a variety of benefits, and this access is not equitably distributed. Studies show that communities of color and low income communities have reduced access to green space than their wealthy white counterparts. This reduced access leads to worsened air quality and lower rates of exercise, which ultimately result in harmful health outcomes. 

This reduced access can be seen on multiple fronts. First, marginalized communities have lower access to urban green spaces and parks near their homes. Additionally, people of color are significantly less likely to visit national parks. There are a variety of reasons for this discrepancy, but the primary source of this is prejudice and a sense of exclusivity in the outdoors community. This lack of green space access and use lead to the negative health outcomes outlined above.

## Outline

- **There is a discrepancy in access to urban green space.** This will be shown via maps. A collection of maps that depict green space in a few cities (Pittsburgh, [New York](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?q=GIS+green+space+), etc.) will be shown on the left side of the screen. There will be a transition to the right side of the screen, which will depict [race](https://pghgishub-pittsburghpa.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/pittsburghpa::parks-open-space-plan-transition-data/explore?location=40.453841%2C-79.934124%2C11.44)/[income](https://pghgishub-pittsburghpa.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/pittsburghpa::pittsburgh-2014-cdbg-block-groups/explore?location=40.429365%2C-79.981385%2C11.26) overlaid onto the map of green space.

- **Why does this discrepancy exist?** There will be some [background information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3590901/) here about why marginalized communities have systemically lower access to urban green space.
- **What about national park access/use?** Pie charts will be used to display the racial and income [breakdown of national park visitors](https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/495294#page19). There will also be a visualization showing [survey results](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/2022/02/historic-discrimination-to-blame-for-diversity-gap-in-us-parks-expert-says/) that describe why people of color don't use national parks at the same rates as their white counterparts (time, culture/safety, cost).

- **Why does this matter?** Visualizations will be used to depict the [effect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1353829218312863) of urban green space on regional air quality and how that [impacts public health](https://davidsuzuki.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/impact-green-space-heat-air-pollution-urban-communities.pdf). The same will be done to show the relationship between green space use/access, [exercise](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3444752/), and [public](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3710158/)/[mental](https://blogs.iu.edu/ecohealth/2021/05/04/the-association-between-green-space-and-physical-activity-on-mental-health/) health.

- **What can we do?** We can implement [more urban green spaces](https://www.nrpa.org/our-work/partnerships/initiatives/parks-for-inclusion/policy-guide/) and [make national parks safer spaces](https://seas.umich.edu/news/creating-welcoming-spaces-national-parks-all-visitors) for people of color. The [Hazelwood Initiative](https://www.hazelwoodinitiative.org/projects-8) in Pittsburgh and other organizations are trying to change the culture around outdoor activities to be more inclusive. This will mostly be imagery.

## Method and Medium

The final deliverable of this project will be a story on Shorthand. There will five sections, as outlined above. Images will portray green space and the disparities in access thereof.
